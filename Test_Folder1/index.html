		<p>As a cretor, I enjoy researching various topics, considering multiple theoretical lenses, when crafting my art. Be it visual, digital, or performance art, I feel my truest self when expressing what plain language simply fails to do. An aspriring polygod, I am deeply interested in linguistics and the ways language provides, strenghthens, and even destroys human relationships. Please enjoy the work presented on this portfolio.</p>
